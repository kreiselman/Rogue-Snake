Rogue Snake is a game made with Unity that builds off of the classic game of snake. In Rogue Snake you will play the game of snake 
with procedurally generated levels that can be tweaked in the main menu.

The options include to change the number of rooms, the wdith of the game grid and how much food is spawned. 

A new level is generated on each playthrough. Howefver some levels that are generated will be faulty and will result in an immediate game over.

Control the game using the arrow keys. The snake will move in the direction pressed or will moved after 2 seconds in the direction its facing if no direction is inputted.
